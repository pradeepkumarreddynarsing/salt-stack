Setup STAGING server
===================

1. Create current STAGING server snapshot
  - NOTE: Before we continue, I strongly suggest you to create Snapshot of this
  very momement STAGING server so you could use it as some kind of template for
  next servers and your future testing.
  - Create snapshot
    - Name: BASE
    - Description:
        OS: Ubuntu 16.04
        Network: dhcp
        User: cb
        Pass: cb
        Tools: ssh, standard system utilities

2. Setup server
    - Start STAGING server
    - Login:
      - login: cb
      - Password: cb
    - check ip address:
      $ ifconfig

    - From local server check if we could ping STAGING server and login
    through terminal
      $ ping 192.168.0.32
      $ ssh cb@192.168.0.32

    - We are on STAGING now, let check ip address to be sure
      $ ifconfig

    - Setup static ip on STAGING server
      $ sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces
        ```
        # The primary network interface
        auto enp0s3
        iface enp0s3 inet static
        address 192.168.0.50
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 192.168.0.1

        dns-nameservers 192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8
        ```

    - Restart enp0s3 network interface
      $ sudo ifdown enp0s3 && sudo ifup enp0s3
    - Let try to ping STAGING server from local machine and login
      $ ping 192.168.0.50
      $ ssh cb 192.168.0.50
        - Setup no password for user cb on STAGING server
        $  sudo visudo
          - at the end of file add this line
          ```
          cb  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
          ```

    - Install figlet on STAGING server and setup message of the day (MOTD)
      $ sudo apt-get install figlet
      - edit MOTD file header
        $ sudo vim /etc/update-motd.d/00-header
      - just before "Welcome ..." line add these two lines
        ```
        figlet $(hostname)
        printf '\n'
        ```
      - logout and login, should see figlet in action

    - Setup password less login from local machine to STAGING server
      - From local machine copy content of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
      - Paste it in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on STAGING server and set up right permissions
        $ vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
          - put content from local machine and save file; append right permissions
        $ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
      - Install common tools on STAGING server
        $ sudo apt-get install htop vim git tmux wget unzip
      - Setup hostname for master (salt-master) on STAGING server in /etc/hosts
        $ sudo vim /etc/hosts
          - add master at the end of first line so it look like
            ```
            127.0.0.1  localhost master
            ```

THERE IS THINGS NEED TO BE ADDED
